<Meta title="TypeScript/object key reference" />

When having an object that you use to define keys for a later reference (e.g. translations), use `keyof typeof` to extract those keys into a type.

This way you will know in the rest of the code what your options are, and references will be typesafe.

```ts
const messages = {
  hello: "Hello my friend",
  listen: "Please listen",
  sleep: "Sleep early",
};

type messageKey = keyof typeof messages;

function reply(msg: messageKey): string {
  return msg;
}

reply("listen");
```
